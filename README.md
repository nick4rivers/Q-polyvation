# Q-polyvation

This is a short script for extracting polygon areas from detrended digital elevation models.

Steps
  - Specify a max elevation in meters for which you would like to limit your polygon extent.
  - Run the script...
  - The first file dialog prompts you to pick a DEM file.
  - The second file dialog prompts you  to pick a directory where you would like your output.
  - Now just wait a bit

The final output should include two directories and a handful of .gpkg files.
